# BlueberryCookbook
A small blueberry recipes app.
This app is a prototype of a cookbook app that shows the user recipes with blueberries as a main ingredient.
Currently, it has an intro page, one recipe, and a sources section.
This is a great app for aspiring chefs who love blueberries.

To use:
* Load the files in Android Studio.
* Build with Gradle.
* Run the app.

* Tap the "Start" button to start.
* Tap the "View Sources" button to view the source of the recipe.

Learned:
In completing this app, I learned how to use the ImageView view, how to set the icon of my app, as well as the tasks we achieved in class:
* Connecting a function to a button
* Using a sub-layout
* Adding a rating widget
* Adding text
* Saving images and string values in the res/ folder
I can now move forward into creating more advanced apps.
